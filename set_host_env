# Description: The bash function 'set_host_env' sets all listed parameters according to two arrays:
# (1) the variable-name array called 'ARRAY_DEFINITION' and the corresponding (2)variable-value array.
# (2) is supposed to be named like the actual hostname of the machine you are going to execute this function.
# When executing the function, it first determines the current hostname and resolves parameters that are
# defined in the array afterwards. In case there are no values present, the 'empty' variables are not set. 
#
# Remark: The function does not validate the actual values. Shit in, Shit out. 
#

#the variable-names that are going to be set for the host 
ARRAY_DEFINITION=(IP TYPE ENV ADMIN)

#the values that are going to be set accordingly when executed
foohost=(192.168.0.1 WEBSERVER production johndoe)

set_host_env()
#Sets all parameters dynamically
{
HOST=`hostname`
ARRAY_LENGTH=${#ARRAY_DEFINITION[*]}
for (( ARRAY_FIELD=0; ARRAY_FIELD<$ARRAY_LENGTH; ARRAY_FIELD++ ))
do
    NAME=${ARRAY_DEFINITION[$ARRAY_FIELD]}
    ARRAY_VAL=${HOST}[$ARRAY_FIELD]
    
    #reset a variable if no value is defined
    if [ "${!ARRAY_VAL}" == "" ]
    then
        unset ${NAME}
    else
        eval ${NAME}=${!ARRAY_VAL}
        echo $NAME=${!ARRAY_VAL}
    fi
done
}
